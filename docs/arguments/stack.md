# stack

A stack is a way to represent any item or block, including information such as metadata, item count and nbtcompounds. 

A stack is a type of [ingredient](/arguments/ingredient/) and can therefore be used in any method as one.

## Argument
Stack information is split using the `:` modifier, with each split item being referred to as a token.  
A stack can have between 2-5 tokens and the number of tokens determine what information is passed in.

### 2 Tokens - Basic Stack

*Note : meta must be a parsable integer*

Creates a stack using the item/block registered by the provided mod and name, using the specified meta data.

```

### 4 Tokens - Stack with Meta and Count

*Note : meta and count must be parsable integers*

Creates a stack using the item/block registered by the provided mod and name, using the specified meta data and item count.

### 5 Tokens - Stack with Meta, Count and NBTCompound
